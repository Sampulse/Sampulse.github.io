    <h1>Esther’s Journey: The Silent Years</h1>
  </header>

  <p>Esther sat at the edge of her bed, the early morning sun barely peeking through the worn curtains of her small apartment. The calendar on her wall hadn’t been updated in weeks, a silent testament to the rhythm her life had taken — waiting. Waiting for a miracle, a breakthrough, or even a whisper from God.</p>

  <h2>The Early Hope</h2>
  <p>Five years earlier, Esther had graduated from university with dreams ablaze. She was full of zeal, faith, and the belief that she was about to step into destiny. She remembered clearly the prophecy she had received at a campus fellowship: "You will stand before kings, a voice of wisdom in places of influence." That night, she journaled those words with tears of gratitude, sealing them with fervent prayers.</p>

  <p>Job applications were sent out. Interviews came and went. For a while, Esther believed the right opportunity would soon knock. But days turned into months. And months quietly slipped into years. What was once optimism became cautious hope — then numbness.</p>

  <h2>The Crushing Reality</h2>
  <p>At twenty-nine, Esther was jobless, single, and slowly losing confidence in her faith. Every Sunday, she watched testimonies of others — people getting jobs, marriage proposals, healing. She clapped, smiled, and whispered, “Thank You Jesus,” though her soul was breaking inside.</p>

  <blockquote>"God, have You forgotten me? Am I invisible to You?"</blockquote>

  <p>Her prayers became shorter. Her journals collected dust. And soon, she stopped going to church altogether. Her mother would call and plead with her, “Just trust Him, Esther. Delay is not denial.” But even that became tiring to hear.</p>

  <h2>A Flicker of Grace</h2>
  <p>One Thursday afternoon, while scrolling through her phone, Esther saw an old message from her former roommate, Ada. It simply read, “I’m praying for you. Isaiah 49:15-16.”</p>

  <p>Out of curiosity, she opened her Bible:</p>
  <blockquote>“Can a woman forget her nursing child…? Yet I will not forget you. See, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands.”</blockquote>

  <p>Something broke in her that moment. Esther wept — not because everything changed instantly, but because she felt seen. For the first time in a long while, she allowed herself to hope again.</p>

  <p>That night, she prayed. Not the fancy, rehearsed kind. It was raw and real: “God, I don’t know where to go from here. But if You’re still with me… please lead me.”</p>

  <h2>The Turning Point</h2>
  <p>Weeks passed. Then, through a recommendation from a neighbor, Esther was invited to volunteer at a literacy center for underprivileged teens. It didn’t pay, but something inside nudged her to accept.</p>

  <p>There, she met children whose pain dwarfed hers. Some were orphaned. Some abused. Many had no hope. Esther found herself pouring into them — tutoring, encouraging, and sometimes just listening. She rediscovered her voice.</p>

  <p>One day, a guest donor visited the center. He noticed her interaction with the children and later approached her. “Have you ever considered working in education policy?” he asked. She laughed it off. “Me? No. I’m just a volunteer.”</p>

  <p>But that meeting sparked a connection. Emails turned into meetings. And eventually, she was offered a job with an international education NGO that advocated for child literacy in rural Africa.</p>

  <h2>The Testimony</h2>
  <p>Now thirty-two, Esther stood before a room full of diplomats and policy influencers in Geneva. Her hands trembled slightly as she shared the story of a teenage girl from her center who learned to read and dreamed of becoming a lawyer.</p>

  <p>After the speech, someone from the audience approached her. “Esther, your voice carries more than words — it carries purpose.”</p>

  <p>As she returned to her hotel room that night, Esther looked at her hands and whispered, “Inscribed… You never forgot me.”</p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>God’s delays are not His denials. Esther’s journey reminds us that silence is not absence. Sometimes, God is shaping the vessel before pouring out the blessing. And when He finally does — it is always worth the wait.</p>
