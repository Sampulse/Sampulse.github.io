    <h1>Healed Through the Thorns – Funke’s Road to Wholeness After an Abortion</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Funke was just 19 when her life changed forever. A bright and hopeful fresher at a top university in Ibadan, she had dreams of becoming a medical doctor. Her parents, proud and prayerful, had sacrificed a lot to see her through school. She was the first daughter in a conservative Christian family — the one everyone looked up to.</p>

    <p>But the pressure to be perfect weighed heavily on her. In her second semester, she began dating Lanre, a charismatic final-year student. What began as innocent chats over lab reports quickly evolved into something deeper. Funke, though hesitant, found herself saying yes to things she never imagined she would.</p>

    <h2>The Mistake</h2>
    <p>One day, her period didn’t come. She waited. Prayed. Waited again. The second month confirmed her worst fears — she was pregnant. Lanre’s reaction was swift and cold. “You know I can’t father a child now. You have to take care of it.”</p>

    <p>Funke was shattered. She felt alone, ashamed, and trapped. She couldn’t bear to tell her parents. Her campus fellowship leader would be disappointed. In her mind, abortion was the only option. She went through with it in a local clinic, alone, in silence and tears.</p>

    <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
    <p>Though the procedure was over, the pain had only begun. Guilt gnawed at her like a vulture. She stopped attending lectures. She avoided church. Her smile disappeared. Whenever she saw babies or heard the word "abortion" mentioned in a sermon, her heart sank.</p>

    <p>One night, she tried to overdose on sleeping pills. She left a note on her bedside table: "God can’t love someone like me." But her roommate, sensing something was wrong, came back to the room early and found her unconscious. Funke survived — barely.</p>

    <h2>The Start of Healing</h2>
    <p>While recovering in the school clinic, a nurse named Mrs. Ajayi stayed by her side. She didn’t ask questions or preach. She just sat, listened, and prayed silently. After days of silence, Funke broke down and confessed everything. Expecting judgment, she was instead met with a warm embrace and these words: “You’re still God’s daughter. Grace didn’t leave you.”</p>

    <p>Mrs. Ajayi connected her to a Christian counselor, who helped her begin the painful, gradual process of healing. Together, they explored Scriptures like Psalm 34:18 — "The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit."</p>

    <h2>Rebuilding</h2>
    <p>Funke returned to school the next semester with a new resolve. She avoided Lanre and ended all contact. She immersed herself in Bible study and joined a small women’s prayer group on campus, where she found strength in vulnerability. For the first time in months, she allowed others to see her — not the perfect daughter, not the broken girl, but the real her.</p>

    <p>She started volunteering at a local maternity center, helping young mothers and mentoring girls about purity, purpose, and God’s unfailing love. Though she still wrestled with regrets, she saw glimpses of redemption in every life she touched.</p>

    <h2>The Testimony</h2>
    <p>In her final year, Funke stood before her campus fellowship and shared her story. Not as a warning, but as a witness. She cried. Others cried. That night, five girls came forward, confessing their own hidden battles. Funke embraced them, whispering, “There’s healing. There’s hope. There’s grace.”</p>

    <blockquote>“Even the thorns in my story have bloomed into something beautiful,” she wrote in her journal.</blockquote>

    <p>Today, Funke is a doctor, serving in a rural clinic where she cares for pregnant teens and speaks at conferences about post-abortion healing. Her past didn’t disqualify her — it qualified her to minister to the broken.</p>

    <p>This is Funke’s story. A testimony that even the worst mistakes cannot cancel God’s mercy. That no matter how far you fall, His arms are longer still — ready to restore, renew, and redeem.</p>
