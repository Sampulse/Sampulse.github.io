    <h1>Daniel’s Detour – When God Closes the Door</h1>
  </header>

  <p>Daniel had it all planned. Graduate at the top of his class, get into a Fortune 500 company, and begin a rapid climb up the corporate ladder. By twenty-five, he had earned a master’s degree, won leadership awards, and even received an offer letter from one of the most prestigious firms in the country. Everything was falling into place—until it wasn't.</p>

  <h2>The Rejection</h2>
  <p>Just weeks before his scheduled start date, Daniel received an email: "We regret to inform you that due to internal restructuring, the offer is hereby withdrawn." It felt like a punch in the gut. He read it over and over, hoping it was a mistake. It wasn't. What followed was a spiral of confusion, frustration, and spiritual silence.</p>

  <p>He tried applying elsewhere, but nothing stuck. Interviews fizzled. Promising leads went cold. Friends moved on with their lives — promotions, engagements, testimonies — and Daniel remained stuck, seemingly abandoned by the God he had faithfully served.</p>

  <h2>Questioning the Path</h2>
  <p>He began questioning his prayers, his plans, even his purpose. “God, if You really called me to succeed, why slam the door when I was already at the threshold?” he often asked, tears streaming in the privacy of his room. Months turned to a year, and the pain hardened into bitterness.</p>

  <blockquote>“Maybe I misheard God. Maybe this whole faith thing doesn’t work.”</blockquote>

  <p>But even in his doubt, Daniel couldn’t completely walk away. One night, scrolling aimlessly on his phone, he stumbled across a quote: “Sometimes God closes a door because He knows it leads to a place you don't belong.” Something clicked. Could it be that the closed door wasn’t punishment — but protection?</p>

  <h2>The Unexpected Detour</h2>
  <p>Not long after, a friend invited Daniel to a local startup bootcamp, just to kill time. Reluctantly, he went. There, he met people with raw ideas, big dreams, and messy execution — and something stirred inside him. He found himself mentoring younger entrepreneurs, helping them structure their thoughts and refine their pitches. It was fulfilling in a way he hadn’t felt before.</p>

  <p>One of the teams he helped later offered him a co-founder position. It wasn’t glamorous or secure, but Daniel felt a peace about it he hadn’t felt in a long time. He said yes. It started small — working from shared coworking spaces, sleepless nights drafting proposals, and knocking on doors that never opened. But they kept at it.</p>

  <p>Daniel began seeing his previous rejection not as failure, but as redirection. He immersed himself in the startup's mission — to provide microloans, training, and digital platforms for artisans in underserved communities. It was slow, frustrating, and unpredictable. Yet, it was exactly where God wanted him.</p>

  <p>He started traveling to rural regions, meeting tailors, shoemakers, and weavers who had talent but lacked support. Their resilience reminded him of his own struggle. He became a bridge between investors and the grassroots community. Slowly, the work started gaining attention.</p>

  <h2>The Rise</h2>
  <p>Fast forward two years, and their startup — named HandLift — had grown beyond imagination. From one local workshop, they expanded into five countries, trained over 2,000 artisans, and helped hundreds of families rise above the poverty line. Major publications featured their work. Daniel, once the almost-corporate executive, had become a purpose-driven leader.</p>

  <p>But beyond the numbers and headlines, what mattered most to him were the stories. Like Grace, a widowed mother of four, who now ran a thriving textile shop. Or Musa, a former street boy, who learned leather craft through their mentorship program. Daniel kept their photos on his desk as daily reminders of why God’s detour mattered.</p>

  <p>One day, speaking at a youth empowerment conference, he shared, “The closed door hurt. But it redirected me. Had God not closed it, I’d never have stepped into what He truly called me to do.” The audience gave him a standing ovation — not for his eloquence, but for his honesty and hope.</p>

  <h2>Wrestling With Faith</h2>
  <p>Of course, not every day was easy. Daniel still had questions, moments of doubt, and seasons where nothing made sense. But he learned to bring those questions to God, not away from Him. He journaled, prayed, cried — and worshiped anyway.</p>

  <p>He once wrote in his diary: “Faith isn’t proven when doors open. It’s proven when you trust God even after they close.” That line became the motto of their foundation. They printed it on t-shirts, mugs, and even hung it in every training center they built.</p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>Sometimes what feels like a rejection is actually redirection. God doesn’t waste pain, and His plans often look nothing like ours. But when we trust the detour, we discover that the road less traveled leads to impact, growth, and a deeper faith.</p>

  <p>Daniel never got that corporate job back. He didn’t become a CEO in a skyscraper. But he did become something more — a vessel. A storyteller. A servant leader. And every step of that journey was marked by God’s fingerprints, even the closed doors.</p>
