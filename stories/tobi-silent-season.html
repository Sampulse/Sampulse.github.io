<h1>In the Silent Season: Tobi’s Story of Trusting God</h1>

<p>Tobi sat alone in his tiny Lagos apartment, eyes fixed on the ceiling fan that spun in lazy circles. Outside, the city roared — cars honking, hawkers shouting — but inside, it was quiet. Not the comforting kind of quiet, but the kind that weighed heavily on your soul. It had been months since Tobi had lost his job at the firm. Months since his phone had buzzed with any good news. And even longer since he felt like God was listening.</p>

<p>Every morning, he woke up and opened his Bible, searching for encouragement. Every night, he knelt beside his mattress, praying — pleading — asking God for just a sign. Something. Anything. But heaven remained silent. That silence began to grow louder than the chaos outside his window.</p>

<h2>Faith in the Waiting</h2>

<p>Tobi remembered his pastor’s words during a sermon months ago: “Sometimes, when God is silent, it’s not that He’s absent — He’s watching your response to the silence.” He had nodded in agreement back then. But now, in the thick of it, it didn’t feel that simple. Silence hurt. And waiting? Waiting felt like slow dying.</p>

<p>Still, Tobi continued. He refused to stop reading the Word. He refused to stop praying. Not because he felt strong, but because something deep inside him — a whisper, a flicker — told him this season had a purpose. Maybe not a visible one, but a holy one.</p>

<blockquote>
  "The Lord is good to those who wait for Him, to the soul who seeks Him." — Lamentations 3:25
</blockquote>

<h2>The Unexpected Phone Call</h2>

<p>On a Wednesday afternoon, as Tobi was reading Psalms with a half-eaten plate of rice beside him, his phone rang. It was an unfamiliar number. He almost didn’t pick it up. But something nudged him to.</p>

<p>“Hello?”</p>

<p>“Hi, is this Tobi Adekunle?”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“This is Mrs. Adeniran from Streams Media Group. We came across your resume on LinkedIn and would love to speak with you about an opening for a junior content producer.”</p>

<p>Tobi blinked. Streams Media Group? He remembered applying to them almost 6 months ago — before everything went quiet.</p>

<p>“Are you available for an interview tomorrow?” she continued.</p>

<p>He almost choked on his rice. “Yes! Yes, I am!”</p>

<p>It was as if heaven had finally cleared its throat.</p>

<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

<p>After the interview, he sat in the waiting area with his hands trembling. Not because he was nervous — but because he finally understood. The silence wasn’t punishment. It was preparation. God had been working behind the scenes. Pruning him. Building endurance. Teaching him to trust beyond emotions.</p>

<p>A week later, Tobi got the job.</p>

<p>He went home, knelt on that same floor he had prayed on for months, and cried — not tears of frustration this time, but of deep, overwhelming gratitude. The silence hadn’t been a wall. It had been a womb, nurturing something beautiful in secret.</p>

<blockquote>
  "Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill His promises to her." — Luke 1:45
</blockquote>

<h2>Reflections</h2>

<p>Tobi now journals everything. Every prayer. Every answered moment. Every moment of doubt turned into victory. His Christian diary, once filled with question marks, is now laced with testimonies of God's perfect timing.</p>

<p>So if you’re in a silent season like Tobi was, don’t lose heart. Silence doesn’t mean absence. Keep praying. Keep believing. Because sometimes, heaven is simply waiting for the perfect time to open the door you’ve been knocking on.</p>
