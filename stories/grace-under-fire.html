    <h1>Grace Under Fire – Blessing’s Deliverance from Campus Cultism</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Blessing Eze was the girl everyone admired in her first year at the University of Port Harcourt. Quiet, intelligent, and raised in a loving Christian home, she had the air of someone marked for greatness. Her father was a pastor, and her mother, a midwife who taught Sunday school. They raised her to fear God and walk in truth. So when Blessing left for university, everyone expected her to shine in character and academics.</p>

    <p>But the university had its own storms waiting for her.</p>

    <h2>The Trap</h2>
    <p>In her second semester, Blessing struggled financially. Her father's church was small, and their monthly stipend was barely enough for food. One evening, after returning from a long day of lectures, she found her roommate, Cynthia, chatting with a group of confident, well-dressed students. One of them, Felix, had a magnetic personality and seemed to know everyone.</p>

    <p>He introduced himself casually and offered Blessing help — notes for a difficult course, a free textbook, and later, money for food. It all seemed harmless. He said he was a “campus influencer” and organized events. Slowly, she began attending some of the meetings. At first, it felt like belonging — a break from loneliness.</p>

    <p>Then came the initiation night. She had no idea what it was at first — Felix simply told her to show up in black. When she hesitated, he reminded her of all he had done for her. “Just come,” he said. “No pressure.”</p>

    <h2>Dark Nights</h2>
    <p>That night changed everything. She found herself at an off-campus apartment filled with chants, alcohol, and disturbing rituals. She panicked. But Felix saw her fear. “You don’t have to do anything. Just stay and observe,” he said, smiling. But once she stayed, there was no going back. Her name had been entered. She was one of them now.</p>

    <p>From there, her life unraveled. She began skipping church. Her prayers felt dry. She’d wake up at night sweating, haunted by shadows. The cult meetings became more frequent, and she was asked to “deliver packages” and “watch targets.” She never did anything violent, but the threat was always there — disobey, and you disappear.</p>

    <h2>The Turning Point</h2>
    <p>In her third year, a tragedy shook the campus — a rival cult attack left three students dead. That night, Felix came to her hostel. “You need to leave town for a while. They’re hunting members.”</p>

    <p>Terrified, she boarded a night bus to Owerri to stay with an aunt. But something in her broke. Sitting alone in that unfamiliar room, she looked in the mirror and couldn’t recognize the girl she’d become. The tears came like a flood. She grabbed her Bible — covered in dust — and opened to Isaiah 1:18: “Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.”</p>

    <p>It felt like a whisper in her spirit: *Come home.*</p>

    <h2>The Return</h2>
    <p>She returned to school after two weeks. She was afraid, but determined. She went straight to her campus fellowship and asked to speak with the pastor. When he saw her brokenness, he didn’t condemn. He listened. He prayed. He cried with her.</p>

    <p>With his help, she met a Christian counselor, confessed everything to her parents, and started the journey back. It wasn’t smooth. She had nightmares, moments of doubt, even fear of being found. But she clung to God’s promise: “If the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.”</p>

    <h2>Healing and Purpose</h2>
    <p>In her final year, Blessing began mentoring other girls on campus. She shared her testimony at fellowships and was invited to churches to speak about cultism, grace, and the God who saves even from the deepest pits.</p>

    <p>She started a blog, *Grace Under Fire*, where she wrote openly about her journey. Hundreds of students sent her messages — some trapped, others seeking freedom. Her story became a lifeline.</p>

    <blockquote>“I thought I was too deep in darkness,” she wrote. “But God found me in the fire and pulled me out with grace.”</blockquote>

    <p>Today, Blessing is a social worker and advocate for campus safety and mental health. She partners with churches and NGOs to create awareness about cultism and help students resist pressure. She continues to tell her story — not with shame, but with courage — knowing that every testimony is a weapon against the enemy’s lies.</p>

    <p>This is Blessing’s story. A reminder that God doesn’t abandon His own. Even when we lose our way, His grace comes running — even through fire.</p>
