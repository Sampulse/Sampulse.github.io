    <p><em>By Christian Diary | Posted August 2025</em></p>

  <p>Tobi’s laughter once filled the halls of every youth service, every choir practice, every family dinner. He was the one people turned to for advice, for comic relief, for prayer. But all that light slowly dimmed when the weight of depression crept into his life — a silent, heavy fog that no one saw coming, not even Tobi himself.</p>

  <p>It started subtly. A missed morning devotion. A skipped choir practice. Fewer calls returned. Tobi chalked it up to fatigue. “I just need rest,” he told himself. But days turned into weeks, and soon, Tobi found himself waking each morning with a hollow chest and tears for no clear reason.</p>

  <p>His friends noticed. “You’ve changed, bro,” said Jide, his childhood friend. But Tobi would smile and change the subject. Because how could he explain to anyone — especially as a Christian leader — that he was drowning in a sadness he couldn’t understand?</p>

  <h2>The Silent Spiral</h2>
  <p>Tobi began to withdraw from the things that once gave him joy. He still prayed, but the words felt forced. He still went to church, but his hands hung limp during worship. He felt guilty — guilty for not being okay, guilty for not having enough faith, guilty for disappointing those who looked up to him.</p>

  <p>“If you’re truly saved, depression should have no hold on you,” a well-meaning brother once told him. That sentence would echo in Tobi’s heart like a curse. He started to believe maybe he wasn’t saved enough. Maybe God was tired of him. Maybe the darkness was his punishment.</p>

  <p>Nighttime became the worst. Alone in his room, thoughts of death began to whisper like old friends. “Just disappear. The world won’t miss you.” He never acted on them, but the thoughts haunted him like shadows behind his eyes.</p>

  <h2>The Intervention</h2>
  <p>One Sunday, after dragging himself to church, Pastor Mary called him aside. “Tobi, I had a dream about you. You were trapped in a dark well, and your hands were bleeding from trying to climb out. But then a rope came down from heaven.”</p>

  <p>He broke down right there in the church office. All his secrets spilled like a broken dam. For the first time in months, someone saw through the smile. Pastor Mary didn’t offer clichés or condemn him. She simply said, “Even Elijah got tired. Even Jesus wept. Your pain doesn’t disqualify you.”</p>

  <p>With her help, Tobi began to seek healing — both spiritually and emotionally. He started therapy with a Christian counselor. He began journaling his thoughts and immersed himself in the Psalms. “Why are you cast down, oh my soul?” David’s cry became his own prayer.</p>

  <h2>The Road to Restoration</h2>
  <p>Healing wasn’t immediate. Some days, the clouds returned. But now Tobi had tools — and more importantly, he had people who reminded him of truth when he forgot. Slowly, he returned to music. His first Sunday back on the keyboard, he cried through every chord.</p>

  <p>He started a small support group for young believers battling mental health issues. They called it “The Olive Room” — a place to be pressed, but not destroyed. Testimonies began to pour in from others who had felt alone, ashamed, unseen.</p>

  <p>One of the most powerful moments came when Tobi stood in front of the youth church and shared his story — unfiltered, raw, redemptive. “I am not weak because I broke down. I’m stronger because I got back up. And I know now that Jesus is with us in the fire, even if we don’t see Him at first.”</p>

  <h2>A Legacy of Light</h2>
  <p>Today, Tobi is a mentor, still playing his music, still sharing his story. Depression didn’t vanish — but its power over him did. He found that the Gospel wasn’t just good news for the afterlife, but strength for the days we can barely breathe.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Don’t let the shame of your struggle silence your praise. Your story can be someone else’s survival guide.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And in the lives of many who once stood at the edge like he did, Tobi’s story now shines as a testimony: that the fire may burn, but it will never consume us — not when God is in it with us.</p>
