    <h1>Waiting on God's Timing</h1>
    <p>Waiting isn’t easy — but it builds faith. Sometimes God delays because He’s preparing something better. Isaiah 40:31 says, “Those who wait on the Lord will renew their strength.”</p>
    <p>Don’t rush. Trust His perfect schedule. Your delay might be God’s design.</p>
