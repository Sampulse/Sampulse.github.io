    <h1>The Power of Daily Devotion</h1>
    <p>Daily devotion keeps us spiritually nourished. Even five minutes of focused prayer and Bible reading can transform your day. When we give God our first moments, we invite His peace into everything else.</p>
    <p>Psalm 5:3 says, “In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.”</p>
    <p>Start small. Be consistent. Watch your faith grow.</p>
