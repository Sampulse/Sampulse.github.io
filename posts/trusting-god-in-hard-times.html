    <h1>Trusting God in Hard Times</h1>

    <p>Life doesn’t always go the way we plan. There are moments we feel forgotten, lost, or broken. But even in those times, God is near. His Word reminds us that He will never leave or forsake us (Hebrews 13:5).</p>

    <p>Trust is a choice. It’s believing that even when we don’t see a way, God is making one. I’ve found that writing down my prayers and tears in my Christian diary helps me stay grounded in faith, even when the storm rages.</p>

    <p>Remember: God’s silence is not His absence. Keep praying. Keep believing.</p>
