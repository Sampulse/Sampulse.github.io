    <h1>How to Start a Christian Diary</h1>

    <p>Starting a Christian diary is simple — and powerful. It’s a way to grow in your relationship with God by writing prayers, verses, reflections, and even struggles.</p>

    <p>You don’t need a perfect format. Begin with what’s in your heart. Here’s a basic idea:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Start with a verse you read today</li>
      <li>Write how it spoke to you</li>
      <li>Pray in writing — talk to God</li>
      <li>End with a praise or request</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Over time, you’ll look back and see how God has been faithful.</p>
