<h1>Why I Keep a Christian Diary</h1>

<p>Keeping a Christian diary has been one of the most life-changing habits of my spiritual journey. It’s not just a notebook — it’s a sacred space where I pour out my heart to God, track His faithfulness, and reflect on His Word.</p>

<h2>1. It Helps Me Hear God More Clearly</h2>
<p>When I write down prayers and thoughts after reading the Bible, I begin to notice patterns and answers that I might have missed. Psalm 77:11 says, <em>“I will remember the deeds of the Lord; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.”</em></p>

<h2>2. It Keeps Me Spiritually Grounded</h2>
<p>Life is busy. Writing helps slow me down and focus on God’s presence. My diary reminds me that I’ve faced struggles before — and God brought me through each one.</p>

<h2>3. It Builds Gratitude</h2>
<p>Reading old entries and seeing how God answered prayers fills me with joy. It encourages me when I feel discouraged or lost.</p>

<h2>Start Yours Today</h2>
<p>You don’t need to be a writer. Just be honest with God. Start with a verse, a prayer, or a short thought. Over time, your diary becomes a powerful testimony of God's love and grace.</p>
